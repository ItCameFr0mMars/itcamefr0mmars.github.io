# 2048 AI

AI for the game [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048).

See it in action [here](https://3kh0.github.io/2048/). (Hit the auto-run button to let the AI attempt to solve it by itself)

You can tweak the thinking time via global var `animationDelay`. Higher = more time/deeper search.

It achieves success rate of about 90% in my testing.

If you find any problems please open a issue.

Have fun!
